# Pacman-Ghost-Stealing-Protocol
Created an AI-enhanced Pacman game using FSM logic and A* pathfinding for ghost behavior. Ghosts steal power pellets in a set sequence. Designed a 1200x720 tilemap with paths, walls and waypoints for Home, Goal and Power Pellets to support strategic movement and gameplay.
